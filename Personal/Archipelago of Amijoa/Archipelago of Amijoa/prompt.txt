The Archipelago of Amijoa

You are a cat collector in a distant land who lives near the archipelago of Amijoa. 
The archipelago is made up of N islands that are inhabited by cats. 
You have a list of M clients, who all want some number of cats to adopt (between 1 and 6). 
Your job is to go and collect these cats from the islands, 
however on every trip you can only bring back exactly enough cats for the next client on your list. 

It takes you one day to visit and collect cats from one island. 
At the start of your job, you know how many cats are on each island. 

However, if three fourths or more of the islands have no cats on them, 
the remaining cats will redistribute themselves evenly amongst the islands. 
If the number of cats is ever less than three times the number of islands, 
two cats will migrate to each island from outside the archipelago. 

For a given set of islands and clients, find the shortest number of days it will take you to find cats for 
your clients to adopt.

Example: The Amijoa archipelago is made up of 4 islands with 2, 1, 5, and 3 cats on them. 
You have 6 clients who want 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, and 4 cats.
