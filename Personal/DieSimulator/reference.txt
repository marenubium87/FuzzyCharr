Todo:
1:  user currently can type garbage into success threshold and the other spinner
        maybe have the element_update subfunctions return 1 if something goes wrong
        and then not run the simulation if that happens
        Warn user when successes value is being reset?
DONE 2:  if there are less than two dice, do we want drop dice to revert back to 
        'do not drop' mode?, no, currently it resets to 0 and that's fine, don't want to be
        randomly changing modes on people
3:  still not happy with plot y-formatting for more degenerate cases... 
          ...when value is greater than 100, consider clamping at 100 maybe, or 120 for spacing
          ...consider splitting into helper fcn
          ...want 8 gridlines - 4 main ones and then 4 minor ones that aren't labeled
          ...make gridlines a bit lighter too i think
4:  add xbar, sx, median/quartile things onto graph
DONE    5.   write filepath to pop-up box instead of just saving "Saved".
6.  Status box for what program is currently doing?
