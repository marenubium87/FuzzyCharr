There once was a cat.  This cat was very plump.
This cat also loved to eat birbs.  The cat believed
that birbs were toys with meat inside.  The birbs
did not enjoy this one bit.  They believed that the
cat was practicing hate speech.  Until abruptly one
day the birbs stopped complaining about the cat,
because they got eaten, and as it turns out birbs,
like other creatures, lose the ability to complain
after they have been consumed.
